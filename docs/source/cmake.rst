Installation
==============

In order to download the application, the user should clone the project from the github page:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/lennertdekeukeleere/Geant4GarfieldDegradInterface.git

The same steps as for any geant4 application are required to compile the GeantGarfieldDegradInterface project: Enter the cloned directory *Geant4GarfieldDegradInterface* and type the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    
If the user is only interested in one of the two setups, he/she should enter one the two directories *ALICE* or *Xenon*, and repeat the steps given above.
